Package featuregate provides a centralized implementation for feature gate functionality
across all controller-tools generators.

This package addresses the code duplication that existed in CRD, RBAC, and Webhook generators
by providing a unified API for:

- Parsing feature gate configurations from CLI parameters
- Validating feature gate expressions with strict validation
- Evaluating complex boolean expressions (AND, OR logic)
- Managing known feature gates with a registry

# Basic Usage

The simplest way to use this package is:

	gates, err := featuregate.ParseFeatureGates("alpha=true,beta=false", false)
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
	}
	evaluator := featuregate.NewFeatureGateEvaluator(gates)

	if evaluator.EvaluateExpression("alpha|beta") {
		// Include the feature
	}

# Expression Syntax

Feature gate expressions support the following formats:

- Empty string: "" (always evaluates to true - no gating)
- Single gate: "alpha" (true if alpha=true)
- OR logic: "alpha|beta" (true if either alpha=true OR beta=true)
- AND logic: "alpha&beta" (true if both alpha=true AND beta=true)

Multiple gates are supported:
- "alpha|beta|gamma" (true if any gate is enabled)
- "alpha&beta&gamma" (true if all gates are enabled)

Mixing AND and OR operators in the same expression is not allowed.

# Strict Validation

For new implementations requiring strict validation:

	registry := featuregate.NewRegistry([]string{"alpha", "beta"}, true)
	evaluator, err := registry.CreateEvaluator("alpha=true,beta=false")
	if err != nil {
		// Handle parsing error
	}

	err = registry.ValidateExpression("alpha|unknown")
	if err != nil {
		// Handle unknown gate error
	}

# Integration

This package provides functions that centralize the feature gate logic
previously duplicated across CRD, RBAC, and Webhook generators:

- ParseFeatureGates() replaces individual parseFeatureGates() functions
- ValidateFeatureGateExpression() replaces individual validateFeatureGateExpression() functions
- FeatureGateEvaluator.EvaluateExpression() replaces individual shouldInclude*() functions

The FeatureGateMap type is compatible with existing map[string]bool usage patterns.
